# Changelog

Template release notes, written for **derived apps syncing updates** (see
[`skills/sync-template/SKILL.md`](skills/sync-template/SKILL.md)). Newest first.

Entry format — one bullet per merged PR, tagged by scope:

- `[app]` touches shipped app code (`MobileApp/`, `Web/`) — a sync will merge it into your app.
- `[skills]` / `[docs]` agent skills, AGENTS.md, guides — merges cleanly unless you edited them.
- **Manual:** anything a derived app must do by hand after the merge.

Entries start with the first template change after the sync tooling landed — group them under a
`## <year>-<month>-<date>` heading, newest first.
